### Gravity Model


```{r echo=FALSE, out.extra='id="gravity-model" scrolling="no" width="100%"'}
knitr::include_url("china-spatial-web-summary.html")
```
<script>iFrameResize({ log: false }, '#gravity-model')</script>

### Map

<div class="container-frames">
<div class="row">
Black lines represent the link weights in the 90th percentile and are drawn between prefecture centroids. Link weight magnitude was estimated from the best-fit model, which includes effects of distance, population size and whether links cross quarantine borders. The map is fully connected and invisible links represent the remaining 90% of links. Administrative units used to fit the model are colored by the first date of infection. Uninfected prefectures are colored grey.
