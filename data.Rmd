## Data Sources

CEID now maintains a public repository of datasets used in our COVID-19 projects. The datasets in the repository were compiled by members of the CEID COVID-19 working group. The data have been formated to be used 'as-is' and are updated often. Data sets were either created from html scraping or manually entered. In the case of the automated web scraping, the raw data and scripts are included. 

Data are publicly available here:
