### The science of reopening: Can testing students work?
by John M. Drake  
August 17, 2020  
Forbes.com

As universities across the nation reopen, CEID Director John Drake discusses testing programs instituted by various universities, as well as models developped at Yale and elsewhere to assess the effectiveness of these programs. Read the complete column at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndrake/2020/08/17/the-science-of-campus-reopening-can-testing-students-work/#6c08a3502c7a" target="_blank">Forbes.com</a>.

### Five approaches to the suppression of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2<br>without intensive social distancing
August 3, 2020  

![](images/suppression-outreach.png)

CEID researchers have [modeled](suppression.html) the effectiveness of generalized and targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions in controling the spread of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2. Generalized policies include limiting large gatherings, wearing face masks, hand washing, enhanced sick leave policies, limiting large gatherings, and other behavioral changes not involving intensive social distancing or shelter-in-place orders. Targeted methods include active case finding, contact tracing, immunity certification, and quarantine. Because non-pharmaceutical policies have disrupted local and state economies, understanding the effectiveness of less disruptive interventions to control SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 is increasingly important. Researchers developed two modeling frameworks to study the effectiveness of targeted strategies in combination with generalized interventions. Results indicated that the four targeted interventions studied are effective. However, generalized methods such as wearing a face mask and reduced densities were determined to significantly improve the effectiveness of targeted interventions.

See [covid19.uga.edu/supression](suppression.html) for complete details and a link to the preprint.

### Surge in Deaths Associated with COVID-19
by John M. Drake  
July 18, 2020  
Forbes.com

COVID-19 deaths have now begun to surge following the earlier surge in case reports. John Drake discusses the ten-day average lag between case reporting and deaths and what it means for predicting daily deaths in the near future. Using the **lagged Case Fatality Rate** (deaths today over cases reported ten days ago), the number of of deaths over the next ten days can be estimated from daily case reports over the **previous** ten days. For the US, Drake predicts new deaths will hover around 1000 per day, ±500.

### Four Reasons Why Coronavirus Cases Are Increasing<br>But Deaths Aren’t—Yet
by John M. Drake  
July 8, 2020

John Drake discusses the discrepancy between numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the current resurgence of COVID-19. Drake explores four possible explanations: time lag, improved treatment, increased testing, and changing age distribution.

### New Tracker for Cases, Deaths and Hospitalizations

The <a href="https://www.ceid.uga.edu" target="_blank">Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID)</a> and the <a href="https://publichealth.uga.edu" target="_blank">College of Public Health (CPH)</a> at UGA have created a [new interactive tracker](tracker.html) that allows users to track the spread of COVID-19 both in the US and worldwide. The tracker allows users to explore cases, hospitalizations, deaths and number of tests for every US state, as well as cases and deaths worldwide. Users can adjust the plots by choosing total or daily numbers, absolute or normalized values, and calendar date versus date since a certain number of cases occurred. The data comes from the Covid Tracking Project and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

### Op-ed by CEID Director John Drake

**Dr. John Drake urges swift, decisive action to curb spread of COVID-19.**

In an op-ed in the *Atlanta Journal-Constitution*, CEID Director Dr. John Drake has called for immediate and decisive intervention to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Based on a study of government intervention in China following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, CEID researchers found a very strong correlation (90%) between how early a major intervention was imposed in a province and the ultimate severity of the outbreak there. The results show that early action yields critical gains, with every delay of 3.8 days leading to a tenfold increase in cases.

CEID's updated stochastic model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Georgia now accounts for human actions that are difficult to quantify with data (e.g., wearing of face masks), in addition to human movement quantified through cell phone data and other sources. The new model fits reported cases, deaths, movement data, and a temporal trend in baseline transmission capturing other human behaviors. The model projects cases, hospitalizations and deaths six weeks out under three social distancing scenarios. [http://covid19.uga.edu/stochastic-GA](stochastic-GA.html).
