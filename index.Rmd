### Five approaches to the suppression of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2<br>without intensive social distancing
August 3, 2020  

![](images/suppression-outreach.png)

CEID researchers have [modeled](suppression.html) the effectiveness of generalized and targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions in controling the spread of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2. Generalized policies include limiting large gatherings, wearing face masks, hand washing, enhanced sick leave policies, limiting large gatherings, and other behavioral changes not involving intensive social distancing or shelter-in-place orders. Targeted methods include active case finding, contact tracing, immunity certification, and quarantine. Because non-pharmaceutical policies have disrupted local and state economies, understanding the effectiveness of less disruptive interventions to control SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 is increasingly important. Researchers developed two modeling frameworks to study the effectiveness of targeted strategies in combination with generalized interventions. Results indicated that the four targeted interventions studied are effective. However, generalized methods such as wearing a face mask and reduced densities were determined to significantly improve the effectiveness of targeted interventions.

### Surge in deaths associated with COVID&#8209;19
July 18, 2020 | by John M. Drake | Forbes.com

COVID&#8209;19 deaths have now begun to surge following the earlier surge in case reports. John Drake discusses the ten-day average lag between case reporting and deaths and what it means for predicting daily deaths in the near future. Using the **lagged Case Fatality Rate** (deaths today over cases reported ten days ago), the number of of deaths over the next ten days can be estimated from daily case reports over the **previous** ten days. For the US, Drake predicts new deaths will hover around 1000 per day, ±500.

### New tracker for cases, deaths and hospitalizations

The <a href="https://www.ceid.uga.edu" target="_blank">Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID)</a> and the <a href="https://publichealth.uga.edu" target="_blank">College of Public Health (CPH)</a> at UGA have created a [new interactive tracker](tracker.html) that allows users to track the spread of COVID&#8209;19 both in the US and worldwide. The tracker allows users to explore cases, hospitalizations, deaths and number of tests for every US state, as well as cases and deaths worldwide. Users can adjust the plots by choosing total or daily numbers, absolute or normalized values, and calendar date versus date since a certain number of cases occurred. The data comes from the Covid Tracking Project and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

### Op-ed by CEID Director John Drake

**Dr. John Drake urges swift, decisive action to curb spread of COVID&#8209;19.**

In an op-ed in the *Atlanta Journal-Constitution*, CEID Director Dr. John Drake has called for immediate and decisive intervention to slow the spread of COVID&#8209;19.  Based on a study of government intervention in China following the initial outbreak of COVID&#8209;19 in Wuhan, CEID researchers found a very strong correlation (90%) between how early a major intervention was imposed in a province and the ultimate severity of the outbreak there. The results show that early action yields critical gains, with every delay of 3.8 days leading to a tenfold increase in cases.

<small class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">November 4, 2020</small><br>
CEID has released its model of spatial spread for US counties. The model looked at county populations, case counts, non-pharmaceutical interventions, commuting flows, flight volumes and Facebook's Social Connectedness Index to build a model that describes how the risk of the outbreak spreading to each county changed over time during the first six months of the pandemic. The model will be useful in the future, when COVID&#8209;19 is eliminated from some counties, as a tool to predict risk of re-introduction. [covid19.uga.edu/spatial-us](spatial-us.html)</p>

<small class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">March 3, 2020</small><br>
The CEID COVID&#8209;19&nbsp;Portal now includes a model that provides insight into the [final size of the ongoing COVID&#8209;19 outbreak](final-size.html). The model estimates global outbreak sizes by probabilistically incorporating the sparking of new local outbreaks across the globe. The model estimates outbreak sizes for best-case, worst-case and average-case scenarios under a range of assumptions, including how fast local containment efforts improve.

<small class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">February 20, 2020</small><br>
Estimates of the *effective reproduction number* $R_{eff}$ outside of China have been updated to account for heterogeneity in transmission. $R_{eff}$ is the average number of secondary infections, taking into account immunity in the population and containment efforts. When $R_{eff} < 1.0$ containment occurs.
See [R-effective outside China](reff-outside.html) for details.

The virus causing the current outbreak of COVID&#8209;19 disease has been officially named **"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2**).  SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 is a sister virus to other SARS-CoVs. The new name replaces the informal virus name "2019-nCoV" and is not to be confused with the disease it causes, COVID&#8209;19.
