### New Tracker for Cases, Deaths and Hospitalizations

The <a href="http://ceid.uga.edu" target="_blank">Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID)</a> and the <a href="https://publichealth.uga.edu" target="_blank">College of Public Health (CPH)</a> at UGA have created a [new interactive tracker](tracker.html) that allows users to track the spread of COVID-19 both in the US and worldwide. The tracker allows users to explore cases, hospitalizations, deaths and number of tests for every US state, as well as cases and deaths worldwide. Users can adjust the plots by choosing total or daily numbers, absolute or normalized values, and calendar date versus date since a certain number of cases occurred. The data comes from the Covid Tracking Project and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

### Op-ed by CEID Director John Drake

**Dr. John Drake urges swift, decisive action to curb spread of COVID-19.**

In an op-ed in the *Atlanta Journal-Constitution*, CEID Director Dr. John Drake has called for immediate and decisive intervention to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Based on a study of government intervention in China following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, CEID researchers found a very strong correlation (90%) between how early a major intervention was imposed in a province and the ultimate severity of the outbreak there. The results show that early action yields critical gains, with every delay of 3.8 days leading to a tenfold increase in cases.

The [nowcast](nowcast.html) of the COVID-19 outbreak size by US state has launched on the 2019 Coronavirus Tracker. The nowcast is an estimate of the total number of unreported cases by state. Nowcasts are estimated for the 50 states and for the US as a whole, and are calculated from COVID-19 case reports and fatalities. [http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/nowcast](nowcast.html)

The CEID Coronavirus Tracker now includes a model that provides insight into the [final size of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak](final-size.html). The model estimates global outbreak sizes by probabilistically incorporating the sparking of new local outbreaks across the globe. The model estimates outbreak sizes for best-case, worst-case and average-case scenarios under a range of assumptions, including how fast local containment efforts improve.

Estimates of the *effective reproduction number* $R_{eff}$ outside of China have been updated to account for heterogeneity in transmission. $R_{eff}$ is the average number of secondary infections, taking into account immunity in the population and containment efforts. When $R_{eff} < 1.0$ containment occurs.
